Hello world, my name is Riya. I am a graduate student studying Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology (E3B). I am interested in research that pertains to the evolution of behavior, reproductive systems/mechanisms of reproductive isolation, and hybridization between species. In my free time I enjoy running, swimming, and playing/watching basketball. I also enjoy reading non-fiction novels, although for 2025 my reading goal is to get back into fiction! Cheers,
R
